## Overview
This was my first Front End Mentor project, it was a great opportunity to test out my very basic CSS and HTML skills, as well as get more comfortable with flexbox.

## My process
I started out by laying out the HTML, and deciding on how I would organize the container and it's contents. Then I proceeded to set up the flexbox properties in CSS so everything lined up correctly. Lastly I added the font family and adjust the coloring, marigns, font weight, etc.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I'd like to find some ways to make the CSS more concise. I feel like there is still an unecessary amount of duplication in this stylesheet.
